# melanoma-detection

This is an attempt to differentiate between three types of skin lesions, melanoma, nevi and seborrheic keratosesone. Melanoma is cancerous; the other three are benign.

The data and objective are from the [ISIC 2017: Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection](https://challenge.kitware.com/#challenge/583f126bcad3a51cc66c8d9a), as presented in the [udacity/dermatologist-ai](https://github.com/udacity/dermatologist-ai) repository. I used the [train](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-dlnfd/datasets/skin-cancer/train.zip), [vaidation](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-dlnfd/datasets/skin-cancer/valid.zip) and [test](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-dlnfd/datasets/skin-cancer/test.zip) data hosted by Udacity.

I originally worked on the problem in the [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) program. I wanted to revisit the problem using the [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) library.
